 * Assignment:  Module 4 - Activity read.go
 *
 * Summary of File:
 *
 *  The program reads information from a file and represents it in a slice of structs. 
 *  It assumes that there is a text file which contains a series of names. Each line of the text 
 *	file has a first name and a last name, in that order, separated by a single space on the line. 
 *
 *	the program will define a name struct which has two fields, fname for the first name, 
 *	and lname for the last name. Each field will be a string of size 20 (characters).
 *
 *	Also, it will prompt the user for the name of the text file, and it will successively read 
 *	each line of the text file and create a struct which contains the first and last names found
 *	in the file. Each struct created will be added to a slice, and after all lines have been read
 *	from the file, your program will have a slice containing one struct for each line in the file. 
 *	After reading all lines from the file, your program should iterate through your slice of structs 
 *	and print the first and last names found in each struct.
